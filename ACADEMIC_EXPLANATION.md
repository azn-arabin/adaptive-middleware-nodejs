# 🎓 Markov Chain Failure Model

## Executive Summary
This project implements a sophisticated **Markov Chain Failure Model** to replace naive random failures with academically rigorous, realistic failure patterns for testing adaptive middleware systems.

## 1. 📚 Theoretical Foundation

### What is a Markov Chain?
- **Definition**: A stochastic process where future states depend only on the current state, not the history
- **Markovian Property**: P(X_{t+1} = s | X_t, X_{t-1}, ...) = P(X_{t+1} = s | X_t)
- **Academic Relevance**: Widely used in reliability engineering, queuing theory, and system modeling

### Why Markov Chains for Failure Modeling?
1. **Realistic Service Behavior**: Services don't fail randomly - they degrade gradually
2. **State Persistence**: Systems tend to remain in their current operational state
3. **Transition Probabilities**: Mathematical foundation for state changes
4. **Academic Rigor**: Based on established stochastic process theory

## 2. 🎭 The Five-State Model

### State Definitions & Characteristics

| State | Failure Rate | Response Delay | Academic Meaning |
|-------|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| 🟢 **HEALTHY** | 5% | 50ms | Normal operation, minimal failures |
| 🟡 **DEGRADED** | 25% | 200ms | Performance degradation, moderate failures |
| 🟠 **FAILING** | 60% | 800ms | System stress, majority failures |
| 🔴 **CRITICAL** | 90% | 2000ms | Near-complete failure, emergency state |
| 🔄 **RECOVERING** | 35% | 400ms | Self-healing process, improving condition |

### State Design Rationale
- **Gradual Degradation**: HEALTHY → DEGRADED → FAILING → CRITICAL
- **Recovery Path**: CRITICAL → RECOVERING → HEALTHY
- **Skip Transitions**: Direct jumps possible (e.g., HEALTHY → FAILING for sudden failures)
- **Realistic Ranges**: Failure rates and delays based on industry observations

## 3. 🔄 Transition Probability Matrix

### Mathematical Representation
```
P = | P_HH  P_HD  P_HF  P_HC  P_HR |
    | P_DH  P_DD  P_DF  P_DC  P_DR |
    | P_FH  P_FD  P_FF  P_FC  P_FR |
    | P_CH  P_CD  P_CF  P_CC  P_CR |
    | P_RH  P_RD  P_RF  P_RC  P_RR |
```

### Implemented Transition Probabilities

**From HEALTHY:**
- Stay HEALTHY: 85% (high stability)
- → DEGRADED: 12% (gradual degradation)
- → FAILING: 3% (sudden failure)

**From DEGRADED:**
- → HEALTHY: 30% (recovery possible)
- Stay DEGRADED: 50% (persistent state)
- → FAILING: 18% (further degradation)
- → CRITICAL: 2% (rare catastrophic jump)

**From FAILING:**
- → DEGRADED: 25% (improvement)
- Stay FAILING: 45% (sticky failure state)
- → CRITICAL: 25% (severe degradation)
- → RECOVERING: 5% (system attempts self-healing)

**From CRITICAL:**
- Stay CRITICAL: 70% (very sticky - hard to escape)
- → RECOVERING: 25% (healing mechanism activates)
- → FAILING: 5% (slight improvement)

**From RECOVERING:**
- → HEALTHY: 40% (successful recovery)
- → DEGRADED: 35% (partial recovery)
- Stay RECOVERING: 20% (recovery in progress)
- → FAILING: 5% (recovery failure)

### Academic Properties Demonstrated
1. **Stochastic Matrix**: Each row sums to 1.0
2. **Absorbing States**: None (all states can transition)
3. **Ergodic Chain**: All states are reachable from any state
4. **Realistic Persistence**: Higher probability to stay in current state

## 4. 📊 Load-Based Adaptation

### Load Factor Influence Algorithm
```javascript
if (loadFactor > 1.5) {
    // High load increases degradation probability
    P(worse_state) *= 1.3
    P(healthy_state) *= 0.7
} else if (loadFactor < 0.5) {
    // Low load increases recovery probability  
    P(recovery_state) *= 1.2
}
```

### Academic Significance
- **Real-world Correlation**: System load affects failure probability
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Transition probabilities adjust to current conditions
- **Bounded Adjustment**: Prevents unrealistic probability values

---

## 5. 🎯 Failure Decision Process

### Per-Request Algorithm
1. **State Check**: Determine current Markov state
2. **Load Adjustment**: Modify failure rate based on current load
3. **Probabilistic Decision**: `shouldFail = random() < adjustedFailureRate`
4. **Error Type Selection**: Weighted random selection of error types
5. **Response Delay**: State-specific delay with random variation (±50%)

### Mathematical Formula
```
AdjustedFailureRate = min(0.95, BaseFailureRate × LoadFactor)
```

### Error Type Distribution
Each state has weighted error types reflecting realistic failure patterns:
- **HEALTHY**: Minor errors (500, 503)
- **DEGRADED**: Mixed errors (500, 503, 408)
- **FAILING**: System stress errors (500, 503, 502, 408)
- **CRITICAL**: Severe failures (503, 500, 502)
- **RECOVERING**: Recovery-related errors (503, 500)

## 6. 📈 Academic Metrics Generated

### Reliability Engineering Metrics

**MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)**
```
MTBF = Total_Healthy_Time / Number_of_Failure_Incidents
```

**MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery)**
```
MTTR = Total_Failure_Time / Number_of_Recovery_Incidents
```

2. **Transition Frequency**: Count of each state transition
3. **Request Success Rates**: Success rate per state
